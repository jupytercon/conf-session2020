# Jupyter notebooks

JupyterCon presentations can be accompanied with a narrative written in a Jupyter notebook.
If you provide a notebook to go with a talk, the organizers can display the contents of that notebook as supplementary materials, alongside the talk video. 

The conference will be using an online learning platform to organize all content as "mini-courses." 
A session—that is, a cluster of talks in a given track that will be shown together—form a mini-course in the platform.

We also have an integrated JupyterHub, and notebooks can be opened in a live interactive session with one click from the platform.

Use a **naming convention** where each notebook file starts with a number, reflecting the order of the talks in the session.

List all notebooks in this README.

Add any Python package dependencies to the `requirements.txt` in the parent directory.


**Recommend** that all notebooks be shared under a dual license: [BSD-3](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) or [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) license for code, and [CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/) license for text and media.

**Recommend** GitHub actions are added to test that dependencies install and notebooks can execute successful.
